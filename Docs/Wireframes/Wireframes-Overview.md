# Wireframes – TruthOrDrink

Create low- or high-fidelity wireframes for the main screens.

Recommended screens:
1. Login / Register
2. Home / Main menu
3. Create Session (select categories + daring level)
4. Join Session (QR-code + manual code entry)
5. Game Screen (show current question, players, actions)
6. Question Management (standard + custom questions)
7. Settings / Profile

For each screen describe:
- Goal of the screen
- Main elements (buttons, inputs, navigation)
- Navigation: from which screen do you come here, and where can you go next?

Export your actual wireframes from Figma / Balsamiq / paper as images or a PDF,
and place them in this folder alongside this file.
